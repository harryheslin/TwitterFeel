# TwitterFeel
TwitterFeel is a web app which utilise the massive amount of data from Twitter API to analyse and retrieve in-depth information from a Twitter user account. This application will allow people to find out how active a Twitter account post their tweets, what is the sentiment for each tweet, how the sentiment moves changes across the previous months, and what are the common tweet topics from a Twitter account. 

The app will return the Twitter account detail, the accountâ€™s past 100 tweets together with its sentiment, a graph of the monthly sentiment analysis, and the popular topics from their past 100 tweets. The application will immediately update this analysis once there is a new tweet posted in the Twitter account.
